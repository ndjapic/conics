These are my early attempts to describe an algorithm for drawing conic 
sections using a projective transformation. The algorithm is written 
in the Pascal programming language from year 1998 to 2000. My plan is 
to rewrite the code, so it becomes a web application using client side 
JavaScript language.

Now when the HTML is so advanced, those programs for geometric
illustration should work on a web page within canvas or svg tag. They
should have a web browser as a platform on which to run, for instance
svg-edit have it, instead of working within java applet. I play with
some code at https://github.com/ndjapic/conics , but programming is
beyond my abilities.
